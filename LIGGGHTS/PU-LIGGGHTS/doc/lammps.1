.SH DESCRIPTION
.B LAMMPS 
LAMMPS is a classical molecular dynamics code, and an acronym for Large-scale 
Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator. LAMMPS has potentials for soft 
materials (biomolecules, polymers) and solid-state materials (metals, 
semiconductors) and coarse-grained or mesoscopic systems. It can be used to 
model atoms or, more generically, as a parallel particle simulator at the 
atomic, meso, or continuum scale.
